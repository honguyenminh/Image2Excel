# Image2Excel
An image file to excel .xlsx file converter.  
Yes, every cell is a pixel in your image. Mind-blowing, right?

## Limitations
- **Your source image should have at most 256 different colors to keep the same color**  
This is due to Excel's limitation of maximum 256 different fill styles.  
**Update: Now the app can process normal images (more than 256 colors) too, BUT the image will be quantized (indexed color, basically color downscaling) to 256 colors before being converted. This might make your image look a bit different from the original (like those GIFs eh?). Try out different quantizing algorithm to see which one is better.**
- **Your source image must have a resolution under 1,048,576 x 16,384**  
But in practice this rarely ever becomes a problem.
- **Can only write to .xlsx OpenOfficeXML format**
because writing to binary .xls is hard, and libraries don't play well
with using Excel as an image viewer. Who would've thought? 🤷

## Usage
This is a console app (for now) so you have to run it from a command prompt
(or terminal if you're a \*NIX user)

Syntax: `Image2Excel <image-path> <output-path>(optional)`
- `Image2Excel` is the path to the executable
- `<image-path>` is the path to source image
- `<output-path>` (optional) is the path to output file.  
*If left out, this will be the image path with `.xlsx` appended*

This help can also be viewed with `Image2Excel --help` or `Image2Excel -h`

THIS APP HAS SUPER OWO POWER
